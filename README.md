## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox / CSS Grid

### What I Learned

In this project, I reviewed layout design and responsiveness.
I focused on structuring content in a flexible way that adapts to different screen sizes
I also practiced using CSS properties and layout techniques to keep the code clean and easy to maintain.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I want to focus on accessibility best practices and improving how I structure CSS for scalability.
